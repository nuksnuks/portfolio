        <p>Here are some of the projects I have worked on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>"mur"</h3>
            <p>One of my passion projects is a ball game based on a street soccer game called "Mur", where players take turns kicking a ball against a wall.<br/>The game is developed in the open-source game engine <b>Godot 4.3</b> and uses GDScript, a specialized scripting language reminiscent of TypeScript and Python.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Shadow Plane Studios.</h3>
            <p>In 2024, I founded <b>Shadow Plane Studios</b>, where we specialize in all aspects of 3D graphicsâ€”from modeling and texturing to rigging, animation, and post-production. We seek to motivate people to push creative boundaries, explore new storytelling techniques, and bring their artistic visions to life through high-quality visuals and immersive experiences.</p>
